# Pokedex SwiftUI Application

Type the name of the Pokemon you want to find in the search bar and press enter, the fetchPokemon function in PokemonViewModel fetches the data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), and is translated using the JSONDecoder and the codable struct in Pokemon. The data is formatted and displayed in ContentView with a Poke ball design made using SwiftUI's built in shapes.

Currently displays data including: image, name, height, weight, type, abilities. 

In the future I intend to add a description of the abilities and the stats data.
